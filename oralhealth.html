										Did you know there’s a link between your oral health and the health of your body overall? Studies show that poor oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, pregnancy complications, and more. The good news is that, together with the team at your Aspen Dental practice, you can take great care of your oral health and possibly help prevent other health issues.

										From the time we’re young, we’re taught good habits on how to maintain a healthy smile: brush twice a day, floss, and rinse. But in your later teen years, you may wake up late for class and skip a step or two. Or you go to bed without brushing your teeth after a late night. Of course, breaking those good habits every once in awhile isn’t going to cause immediate damage to your teeth. However, the reality is that maintaining oral health on a daily basis goes beyond brushing a couple of times a day when you remember. Without brushing, flossing and rinsing, teeth build up plaque that produce acids, wearing away tooth enamel. Making sure that your brush in the morning and before bed will help prevent buildup and tooth decay in the long run.

										Depending on your oral health, you should talk to your dentist about what type of toothbrush you should be using. For example, someone with braces will need a special kind of toothbrush to clean between brackets. Younger children will need softer, smaller brushes to gently clean their teeth.  Generally, there are two main kinds of toothbrushes to choose from: manual and electric brushes. Both are able to thoroughly clean teeth; it just depends on your preference and what your dental hygienist recommends for you. All come in a variety of shapes and sizes to fit comfortably in your mouth. When purchasing a toothbrush, dental experts recommend that you look for the ADA Seal of Acceptance.

											As you clean your teeth right before bed or early in the morning, you may not be giving much thought as to how you do it. To make sure that your teeth are effectively cleaned when you brush and floss, you need to be using the proper techniques.

											For brushing, you need to hold your toothbrush at a 45 degree angle, gently moving back and forth across your teeth in short strokes. Be sure to brush the chewing surfaces, inside, and outside of all your teeth. Also brush your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath.

											For flossing, use 18 to 24 inches of dental floss to clean between each tooth. Make a C shape around each tooth, gently following the natural shape of your teeth. Clean beneath the gum line, and avoid snapping the floss on your gums.
